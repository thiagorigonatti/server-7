1. Extract it to your Mods folder.

2. Create a discord application and a bot in https://discord.com/developers/applications, copy the BotToken paste it in BotToken value area.

3. Invite the bot to your server.

4. Copy a textchannel id from the discord server your bot is in and paste in it's place.

5. To get your SteamWebApiKey use https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey; so paste it in SteamWebApiKey value area. `This is used to fetch steam and grab public players profile info, like nickname, avatar, country and custom url, then use them when discord logging players messages/commands issued in 7dtd server. This is a web api key and shall be secure, this one is not that one that can be used to trade items, so even if you are careless and leak it, don't worry, just revoke it in the same site where you created.`

6. Start your server.

Thank you for downloading it!
